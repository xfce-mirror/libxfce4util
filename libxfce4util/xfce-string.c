/**
 * xfce_str_replace:
 * @str         : the input string.
 * @pattern     : a search pattern in @str.
 * @replacement : replacement string for @pattern.
 *
 * Searches @str for occurances of @pattern and replaces each
 * such occurance with @replacement. Returns a newly allocated
 * copy of @str on which the given replacement were performed.
 * The caller is responsible to free the returned string using
 * g_free() when no longer needed.
 *
 * Note that @pattern and @replacement don't need to be of the
 * same size. If @replacement is %NULL, the pattern will be
 * removed from the string.
 *
 * Note for future Xfce developers: Deprecate this function when
 * g_string_replace() is available. (Added since Glib >= 2.68)
 *
 * Returns: a newly allocated copy of @str where all occurances of
 *          @pattern are replaced with @replacement. Or %NULL if
 *          @str and/or @pattern is %NULL.
